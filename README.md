# 🔌 Logic Gate Trainer PCB – Transistor-Based Educational Board

This project is a **DIY PCB Trainer Board** designed to help learners understand the working of basic **digital logic gates** — AND, OR, and NOT — using only **transistors and common components**, with **no ICs involved**. Perfect for electronics students, hobbyists, and makers who want to **visualize logic gate behavior** in a hands-on way.

## ⚙️ Tools & Software Used

- ✅ [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) – for schematic and PCB design
- ✅ Schematic capture & PCB layout in one tool
- ✅ 3D Preview & Gerber file export

---

## 🔋 Power Supply

- Powered by **2x CR2032 coin cells**
- VCC and GND buses are clearly marked
- No external power source required

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Download and open** the `Project.json` or Gerber files in EasyEDA.
2. **Check the schematic** and layout for logic gate implementations.
3. **Fabricate the PCB** using the Gerber files.
4. **Solder the components** as per the silkscreen and schematic.
5. **Insert CR2032 batteries** and press input switches to see the LEDs respond according to logic.
